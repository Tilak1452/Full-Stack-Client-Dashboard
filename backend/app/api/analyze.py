Analyze API Router (app/api/analyze.py)

This module defines the API boundary for the analysis feature.
It is responsible for handling incoming requests, validating input,
and returning structured responses.

Responsibilities:

1. Router Definition
   - Uses FastAPI's APIRouter to create a modular route group.
   - Keeps this feature isolated from the main application file.
   - Promotes clean and scalable architecture.

2. Request & Response Schemas
   - Enforces strict input validation using AnalyzeRequest.
   - Ensures consistent output structure using AnalyzeResponse.
   - Prevents invalid or unstructured data from entering the system.

3. API Contract Enforcement
   - Defines a POST endpoint at "/analyze".
   - Automatically validates request payloads.
   - Guarantees response format consistency.

4. Separation of Concerns
   - Contains no business logic.
   - Acts only as a thin controller layer.
   - Designed to delegate processing to a future service layer.

5. Extensibility
   - Stub response currently returned.
   - Ready for service injection (e.g., LLM processing, analytics engine).
   - Easily testable and maintainable.

Overall, this module serves as the API interface layer,
ensuring modularity, strict validation, and production-ready structure.
