Holding Model (holding.py)

Responsibilities:
1. Represents a single stock position inside a portfolio.
2. Stores the stock symbol, number of shares, and average buy price.
3. Linked to a parent Portfolio via a foreign key.

Relationships:
- Many Holdings → One Portfolio (many-to-one).
- Cascade: If a Portfolio is deleted, all its Holdings are deleted automatically.
